## Information

Here you can find config settings for various apps, editors and linters I use. I'd suggest not copying them directly but referencing what I have and what ones might make sense for you.

Also, make sure to check out my [**/uses**](https://kepinski.me/uses) page for more information!

## Acknowledgments
